<!--
Front-end Interview Test:
=======================
# Use either jQuery, Angular/Vue/React, or core javascript (don't use anything that requires a build step).
# Refer to mockups.
# Tasks are listed in order of preference of completion.
 
1)  Get list of Star Wars characters from this endpoint:  http://swapi.co/api/people/  (you might need to approve URL via GE's Zscaler)
2)  For each character, print out name, height, and first 3 film URLs — font-family is Verdana.
3)  Make responsive per mockup (use CSS flex box; no javascript) — chart width is 60% of window.
4)  When hovering over URLs, animate per this spec:
      - Transition min-width from 50% to 100% at 0.3 seconds speed.
      - Transition background color from #9ee to #fee at 0.3 seconds speed.
5)  Convert height from centimeters to feet/inches.
6)  Use "zebra striping" (alternating row colors) per mockup (gray is #eee).
